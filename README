GCcorrect is tool to normalize a library of aligned genome sequencing reads for local genome sequence GC bias.

The program takes as input the reference sequence of a chromosome in fasta format i.e. chr1.fa

We also assume that we have previously aligned reads to this chromosome and therefore have the read counts per position in this chromosome.  

These observed read counts per position are stored in a tab delimited text file called counts_per_position_chr1.txt, where the header assumed is
