# Inputs

#1. genome sequence for chromosome 1 (download from web this is reference sequence)
#2. read counts at positions xi along chromosome 1  (simulate this)
#3. positions xi along chromosome 1
#4. window size w (where [xi:xi+w] is the range for calculating GC content at position xi)
#5. bin size b (where bins are non-overlapping regions across chromosome 1 for correcting GC)
#6. function describing an assumed relationship between read counts vs GC content in windows to predict read count for given GC content


###########
# Output

#1. bins positions as a range
#2. observed counts per bin 
#3. predicted counts per bin
#4. corrected counts per bin


##########
# Steps to divide up between us

#1.  Download reference sequence for chromosome 1 (Done!)
#2.  Create a read count file including positions for each read count (positions are in chromosome 1) [DP]
#	 two columns (tab delimited) with header "Position"  "Count"

#3.  Create the function describing GC bias (GC increments from 0:1 in steps of 0.01) This will be a tab delimited file with header "GC" and "PredictedCount"  [IL]
#4.   Makefile  [NT]
#5.   Readlines()
#6.   get_position_GC()
#7.   get_predicted_position_count()
#8.   correct_bin_count()  # including summarising predicted_bin_count
#9.   write_bin_statistics()
#10.   tests()
#11.   GitHub repository() [NT]
#12.  README file [IL] -> [NT] 
#13.  main python script (gc_correct.py), with looping etc. [IL]

########
# Outline of python script  gc_correct.py

# initiate bin_position counter (i.e. where we are in a bin)
# initiate chr_postion in chromosome 
# read lines till end of window for current position xi (readLines(), get enough lines from chr1.fa to get GC for the current position)
# get GC for that position (get_GC())
# then get predicted count for that position 
# store prediction in temporary vector 
# if bin_position==b (yes, bin_position=0 and output bin statistics, no increment bin_position)
# increment to chr_position

##################
# Makefile
#1.  input chr*.fa
#2. python script

#########
# Tests
#4. have we reached the end of the bin
    have we got the prediction for each position in the bin
